# Spring-Boot-Course-Application
This repository contains a Spring Boot application for managing courses, built using Java Persistence API (JPA) and Hibernate. The application provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for courses, allowing users to perform operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving course information.

Features:
Course Management: Create, read, update, and delete courses.
JPA and Hibernate Integration: Utilizes JPA for database persistence and Hibernate as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for mapping Java objects to database entities.
RESTful API: Exposes RESTful endpoints for interacting with course data, facilitating integration with other applications.
Database Integration: Supports various databases compatible with Spring Boot and Hibernate, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2, etc. But I have used MySQL
